## Define an index that satisfies a given set of requirements

Sure! Here's an example of how you might define an index in Elasticsearch to satisfy a given set of requirements:

### Requirements:
1. Store information about books, including title, author, publication year, genre, and ISBN.
2. Allow full-text search on book titles and authors.
3. Support filtering books by genre and publication year.
4. Enable sorting books by publication year in ascending order.
5. Ensure efficient indexing and retrieval of book data.

### Index Definition:
```json
PUT /library
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title": { "type": "text" },  // Full-text search on book titles
      "author": { "type": "text" }, // Full-text search on authors
      "publication_year": { "type": "integer" }, // For filtering and sorting
      "genre": { "type": "keyword" }, // For filtering
      "isbn": { "type": "keyword" } // Unique identifier for each book
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Index Name**: `library`
- **Mappings**: Define the structure of the documents stored in the index.
  - `title` and `author` are of type `text` to enable full-text search.
  - `publication_year` is of type `integer` to allow filtering and sorting by year.
  - `genre` is of type `keyword` to enable efficient filtering.
  - `isbn` is of type `keyword` and could serve as a unique identifier for each book.

With this index definition, you can efficiently store and query information about books while satisfying the specified requirements.


## Define and use an index template for a given pattern that satisfies a given set of requirements

Certainly! Index templates in Elasticsearch allow you to automatically apply settings, mappings, and configurations to indices that match a specific pattern. Let's define an index template for a given pattern that satisfies the following requirements:

### Requirements:
1. Store logs for different applications, each with different fields.
2. Ensure that the `timestamp` field is mapped as a date type.
3. Apply a default number of shards and replicas to new indices matching the pattern.
4. Set specific mappings for certain fields.

### Index Template Definition:
```json
PUT /_template/logs_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["logs-*"], // Pattern to match indices created for logs
  
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3, // Default number of shards
    "number_of_replicas": 1 // Default number of replicas
  },
  
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic_templates": [ // Define mappings for dynamic fields
      {
        "strings": {
          "match_mapping_type": "string",
          "mapping": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword",
                "ignore_above": 256
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    ],
    
    "properties": {
      "timestamp": { "type": "date" }, // Ensure timestamp field is mapped as date type
      
      // Specific mappings for certain fields
      "application": { "type": "keyword" },
      "severity": { "type": "keyword" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Usage:
- This index template will be applied to all indices created with names matching the pattern `logs-*`.
- It ensures that new indices created for logs have three primary shards and one replica by default.
- The `timestamp` field is mapped as a date type to enable time-based queries.
- Dynamic templates are used to map string fields as both text and keyword to support full-text search and aggregations.
- Specific mappings are provided for fields like `application` and `severity`.

With this index template, you can maintain consistency and apply predefined configurations to indices storing logs from various applications, meeting the specified requirements.

## Define and use a dynamic template that satisfies a given set of requirements

Certainly! Dynamic templates in Elasticsearch allow you to define mappings for fields that match certain patterns. Let's define a dynamic template that satisfies the following requirements:

### Requirements:
1. Store documents related to different products, each with different properties.
2. Ensure that string fields are mapped as both `text` and `keyword` types.
3. Exclude specific fields from being indexed.

### Dynamic Template Definition:
```json
PUT /_template/products_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["products-*"], // Pattern to match indices created for products
  
  "mappings": {
    "dynamic_templates": [
      {
        "strings": {
          "match_mapping_type": "string",
          "mapping": {
            "type": "text",
            "fields": {
              "keyword": {
                "type": "keyword",
                "ignore_above": 256
              }
            }
          }
        }
      },
      {
        "exclude_fields": {
          "match": "*_description", // Match fields ending with "_description"
          "mapping": {
            "type": "text",
            "index": false // Exclude from indexing
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Index Patterns**: This template will be applied to indices created with names matching the pattern `products-*`.
- **Dynamic Templates**: Two dynamic templates are defined:
  1. **Strings Template**: Matches string fields and maps them as both `text` and `keyword` types, allowing full-text search and keyword-based aggregations.
  2. **Exclude Fields Template**: Matches fields ending with "_description" and excludes them from indexing. This could be useful for large textual descriptions that don't need to be searchable.

### Usage:
- When indices are created with names matching the pattern `products-*`, this dynamic template will be automatically applied.
- String fields will be mapped as both `text` and `keyword` types.
- Fields ending with "_description" will be excluded from indexing.

This dynamic template ensures flexibility and consistency in mapping fields for documents related to different products, meeting the specified requirements.

## Define an Index Lifecycle Management policy for a time-series index

Certainly! Index Lifecycle Management (ILM) in Elasticsearch allows you to automate the management of indices over time, including actions like rollover, retention, and deletion. Let's define an ILM policy for a time-series index with the following requirements:

### Requirements:
1. Roll over indices based on the size of the documents.
2. Keep a maximum of 30 indices.
3. Delete indices older than 90 days.

### ILM Policy Definition:
```json
PUT /_ilm/policy/time_series_policy
{
  "policy": {
    "phases": {
      "hot": {
        "actions": {
          "rollover": {
            "max_size": "50GB" // Roll over when index size reaches 50GB
          }
        }
      },
      "warm": {
        "min_age": "30d", // Move indices to warm phase after 30 days
        "actions": {
          "shrink": {
            "number_of_shards": 1 // Reduce the number of shards
          },
          "forcemerge": {
            "max_num_segments": 1 // Optimize segments
          }
        }
      },
      "delete": {
        "min_age": "90d", // Delete indices older than 90 days
        "actions": {
          "delete": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Policy Name**: `time_series_policy`
- **Phases**:
  1. **Hot Phase**: Indices remain in this phase when they are actively being written to. They are rolled over when their size reaches 50GB.
  2. **Warm Phase**: Indices move to this phase after 30 days. The number of shards is reduced to optimize storage, and segments are forcibly merged for better performance.
  3. **Delete Phase**: Indices older than 90 days are deleted.

### Usage:
- Apply this policy to your index template or directly to your index settings to automate the lifecycle management of time-series indices.
- Ensure that the index template or index settings reference this policy so that it gets applied to newly created indices.

This ILM policy will effectively manage your time-series indices according to the specified requirements, ensuring efficient resource utilization and data retention.

## Define an index template that creates a new data stream

To create a new data stream in Elasticsearch, you can define an index template that specifies the index settings, mappings, and aliases for the data stream. Here's how you can define an index template to create a new data stream:

### Index Template Definition:
```json
PUT /_index_template/my_data_stream_template
{
  "index_patterns": ["my_data_stream-*"], // Pattern to match indices created for the data stream
  "data_stream": {}, // Indicates that this template creates a data stream
  
  "template": {
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 1,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    },
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "timestamp": { "type": "date" }, // Example mapping for a timestamp field
        "message": { "type": "text" } // Example mapping for a text field
        // Add mappings for other fields as needed
      }
    },
    "aliases": {
      "my_data_stream": {} // Alias for the data stream
    }
  }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Index Template Name**: `my_data_stream_template`
- **Index Patterns**: This template will be applied to indices created with names matching the pattern `my_data_stream-*`.
- **Data Stream**: The `data_stream` field indicates that this template creates a data stream.
- **Template Settings**: Define settings such as the number of shards and replicas for indices in the data stream.
- **Mappings**: Define mappings for fields in the documents stored in the data stream. In this example, `timestamp` is mapped as a date type and `message` as a text type.
- **Aliases**: Define an alias for the data stream. This alias can be used to refer to the data stream in queries and operations.

### Usage:
- Apply this index template to your Elasticsearch cluster.
- When you index documents with index names matching the pattern `my_data_stream-*`, Elasticsearch will automatically create a new data stream with the specified settings, mappings, and alias.

This index template will help you create and manage a new data stream in Elasticsearch with the desired configuration. You can adjust the settings, mappings, and alias according to your specific requirements.
